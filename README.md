An introductory course to UNIX.

There are a few PDFs:
- A tutorial with basics of UNIX: `tutorial-1`
- A tutorial for git CLI: `tutorial-git`
- 3 projects of varying difficulty:
  - `c-environment`, easy
  - `shell-scripting`, medium
  - `myps`, difficult

There is also an automated tool to correct the git exercise of `tutorial-git` in `tutorial-git-moulinette/`. The code is pretty much garbage, but it works.

To re-generate a PDF, say tutorial-1: `pdflatex tutorial-1.tex`
